# DataMining-MiniProj  

You are to perform predictive analysis (classification) upon a data set: model the dataset using
methods we have discussed in class: logistic regression and support vector machines, and making
conclusions from the analysis. Follow the CRISP-DM framework in your analysis (you are not
performing all of the CRISP-DM outline, only the portions relevant to the grading rubric outlined
below). This report is worth 10% of the final grade. You may complete this assignment in teams of
as many as three people.  

Write a report covering all the steps of the project. The format of the document can be PDF,
*.ipynb, or HTML. You can write the report in whatever format you like, but it is easiest to turn in the
rendered Jupyter notebook. The results should be reproducible using your report. Please **carefully
describe every assumption and every step** in your report.  

A note on grading: A common mistake I see in this lab is not investigating different input
parameters for each model. Try a number of parameter combinations and discuss how the model
changed.  

## SVM and Logistic Regression Modeling  

* **[50 points]** Create a logistic regression model and a support vector machine model for the
classification task involved with your dataset. Assess how well each model performs (use
80/20 training/testing split for your data). Adjust parameters of the models to make them
more accurate. If your dataset size requires the use of stochastic gradient descent, then
linear kernel only is fine to use. That is, the SGDClassifier is fine to use for optimizing logistic
regression and linear support vector machines. For many problems, SGD will be required in
order to train the SVM model in a reasonable timeframe.  

* **[10 points]** Discuss the advantages of each model for each classification task. Does one type
of model offer superior performance over another in terms of prediction accuracy? In terms of
training time or efficiency? Explain in detail.  

* **[30 points]** Use the weights from logistic regression to interpret the importance of different
features for the classification task. Explain your interpretation in detail. Why do you think
some variables are more important?  

* **[10 points]** Look at the chosen support vectors for the classification task. Do these provide
any insight into the data? Explain. If you used stochastic gradient descent (and therefore did
not explicitly solve for support vectors), try subsampling your data to train the SVC modelâ€”
then analyze the support vectors from the subsampled dataset
